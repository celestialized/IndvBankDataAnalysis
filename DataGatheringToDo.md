## Regulatory Filings Data Gathering Project (Stage 1)

**Goal:** identify what individual bank regulatory filing data is available. 

1. **Identify** which EU countries make bank-level regulatory filings accessible.
	
	1.2 **Completed 1:** I have created a spreadsheet `BankFilingsDataSources` identifying the authorities responsible for gathering this data by country. 
	
	- `BankFilingsDataSources` is available at <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At4PfS_dcEwRdFE2SndRYnV0NlhjRXNIcmEwQ09xMUE&usp=sharing>
	
	1.2 **Completed 2:** I have checked a number of countries to see if the data is available through their websites. I have also gathered the data for the US as well as contacted the UK authorities (FCA) and learned bank-level regulatory filing data is not available through them.
	
	1.3 `BankFilingsDataSources` also contains links and instructions for accessing Commission state-aid data for financial institutions and EBA aggregate data, including how many banks a country has in a year (since 2008) as well as how many regulatory actions were taken. Unfortunately about a quarter of countries do not report this data to the EBA. 

	1.4 **Christopher To-do:** Contact the regulatory authorities for which data is not available on their website to determine if they make the data available in another format. Also, enquire regarding data on *failures, mergers, and acquisitions*.
	
	1.5 **Sahil To-do:**
	
	- Further check if data is available for: France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark.
	
	- For the countries that data is available online, note what is available: dates, intervals, if the data is only for domestic operations, foreign or consolidated, NPL ratios, Capital adequacy ratios, total assets/liabilities, types of assets/liabilities, especially securities exposure, trading book/banking book (see `BankFilingsDataSources` for full list). 
	
2. **Second Step:** Coordinate with Mark C. and David S. regarding possibility of filling in holes with Bankscope data. 

3. **Third Step:** At the end of the data identification stage we need to **determine**: 

	- Whether or not the data is comparable across countries and data sources.
	
	- How small of banks to consider.

	- What country sample will allow us to make valid inferences.
